# Casper Chess singleplayer

To run the program:

	clone the repo
	run npm install
	run npm nodemon server.js
	run npm start
	
Frontend server will start on localhost:3000
backend server will start on localhost:6100


# If you experience issues:
	Make sure the node address in server.js is active/responsive (eventually this wont be an issue when casper has a node consolidation
		service like ethereum does with infura)
	
	
	Make sure the dependencies are installed
	
	if this doesnt work, try running npm run build, then serve -s build (if using vscode)
