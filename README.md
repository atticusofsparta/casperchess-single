# casperchess-single

To run the app, open a terminal in the app folder and run ```nodemon server.js```
Then, open another terminal and run ```serve  -s build```

After this the app should be running on http://localhost:3000

Alternatively you can you to http://casperchess.hotchocolate.finance to see it. However since the casper signer is not able to read it, you will not be able to interact with it without installing the signer under devoloper mode and modifying the manifest.json file to include http://casperchess.hotchocolate.finance.
